# Week 3 â€“ Coding Practice Problems

1. Merge Two Sorted Lists (#21) : Linked lists
2. Maximum Subarray (#53) : Dynamic programming
3. Climbing Stairs (#70) : Fibonacci-style DP
4. Min Stack (#155) : Stack + auxiliary structure

## Reflection
Week 3 problems expanded from arrays into **linked lists, stacks, and DP basics**.
