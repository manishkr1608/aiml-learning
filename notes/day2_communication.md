# Day 2 â€“ Communication Reflection

Today I practiced Python basics and used pandas to analyze and visualize simple data.  
I revisited the Simple Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory and Singleton design patterns in conjunction with SOLID
I also captured a key product vision insight: use third-party AI APIs for speed, but build in-house when differentiation or long-term ROI matters.
