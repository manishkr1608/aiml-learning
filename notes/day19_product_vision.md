# Day 19 â€“ Product Vision: Designing an AI Team/Org

## Insight: AI leadership is not just about tech, but structuring teams.

### Possible Org Models
- Centralized AI team: One hub for all AI initiatives (efficiency, but bottlenecks)  
- Embedded AI squads: AI experts inside each product team (alignment, but risk of silos)  
- Hybrid: Core platform team + embedded applied teams (balance of efficiency & focus)

## Takeaway: The org design should match company stage and AI maturity. Start centralized, evolve toward hybrid as scale grows.
