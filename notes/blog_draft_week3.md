# Blog Draft: Week 3 of My AI Director Journey â€“ Balancing Complexity

In Week 3, I stepped into more advanced machine learning models and learned how design patterns keep complexity manageable.

## Technical Progress
- Explored SVMs, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting on the Diabetes dataset
- Compared performance metrics across models
- Reinforced coding practice with linked lists, dynamic programming, and recursion problems

## Architecture Insights
- Builder pattern - assemble ML pipelines step by step
- Chain of Responsibility - preprocessing workflows
- Facade - simplify complex ML subsystems for ease of use

## Leadership Learnings
- Developed thinking around AI roadmaps
- Learned how to prioritize features by effort vs value
- Explored North Star metrics as guiding lights for AI products

## Reflection
This week pushed me to see ML not as isolated models but as part of a bigger system.  
Balancing technical depth, architecture, and leadership vision is already making me think like an AI Director.
