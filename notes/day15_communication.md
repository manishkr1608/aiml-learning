# Day 15 â€“ Communication Reflection

- Trained an SVM on Diabetes dataset and compared performance against a baseline.  
- Explored Builder pattern, useful for dynamically constructing ML pipelines.  
- Captured the need for a structured AI roadmap balancing quick wins with long-term bets.  
- Completed Week 3 coding practice problem: Merge Two Sorted Lists.  
- I will expand into more advanced ML models in Week 3.
