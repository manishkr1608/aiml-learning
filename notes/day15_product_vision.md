# Day 15 – Product Vision: Building an AI Roadmap

## Insight: Beyond metrics, AI leaders must create a roadmap that balances quick wins and long-term bets.

### Roadmap Example
- Short-term (1–2 quarters): Use pre-trained APIs for speed (sentiment, OCR, translation)
- Mid-term (2–4 quarters): Build custom ML models for differentiation
- Long-term (1–2 years): Develop proprietary LLM-based features or AI platforms

## Takeaway: A roadmap prevents scattershot AI projects and aligns teams around milestones.
