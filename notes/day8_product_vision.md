# Day 8 – Product Vision: Customer Churn as a Success Metric

## AI features should be linked to retention.  
- Churn Rate = (# customers lost in period) / (total at start of period)

### Example
- Start: 1,000 customers  
- End: 950 customers  
- Churn = (1000 – 950) / 1000 = 5%  

# Takeaway: If AI personalisation reduces churn, it directly boosts revenue.  
AI success = lower churn over time.
