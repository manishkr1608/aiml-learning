# Day 27 â€“ Product Vision: AI Monetization Models

**Insight:** Monetization defines sustainability of AI products.

### Key Models
1. **API Usage Pricing** (per call / per token)
2. **Feature Differentiation** (AI-powered premium tiers)
3. **Outcome-based Pricing** (e.g., frauds prevented, churn reduced)
4. **Platform Play** (lock-in via data or ecosystem tools)

**Leadership takeaway:** Choose pricing aligned with *delivered value*, not computational cost.
