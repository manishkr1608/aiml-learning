**Framework (4Es):**
1. **Educate** → Train teams & users on what AI can/can’t do  
2. **Enable** → Provide easy tools, APIs, integrations  
3. **Engage** → Build trust via explainability & reliability  
4. **Expand** → Track adoption metrics, scale successful pilots

**Takeaway:** Adoption is a staged process — leaders must move organizations systematically from awareness → usage → expansion.
