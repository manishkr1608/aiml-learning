# Week 2 – Design Patterns Summary

- Day 8: Proxy → lazy-loading ML models
- Day 9: Composite → chaining steps in pipelines
- Day 10: Extended Decorator → timing/logging training

## Reflection
- Proxy is critical for managing heavy/remote models(LLMs, APIs).
- Composite is the backbone of modular ML pipelines.
- Decorators give cross-cutting features like logging, metrics, retries.
