# Day 26 – Product Vision: AI Compliance & Regulations

**Insight:** Compliance is becoming central to AI product leadership.  

### Key Areas
- **GDPR / Data Privacy:** Right to explanation, data minimization  
- **EU AI Act:** Risk-based classification of AI systems  
- **Healthcare (HIPAA):** Patient data protection  
- **Finance (AML/KYC):** Transparency, auditability

**Takeaway:** Leaders must build compliance into AI design from the start — not bolt it on later.
