# Day 5 – Communication Reflection

- Trained my first ML model (logistic regression) with scikit-learn, practiced encoding and evaluation.  
- Learned the Decorator pattern and how can we enable logging etc in existing feature.
- Captured a leadership insight: every AI project should include a clear ROI calculation before building.

# Points to remember 

- Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm, not regression (despite its name).

- Logistic regression is a probabilistic classification model that uses a sigmoid function to output probabilities and a decision threshold to classify outcomes.

- It’s used when the target (output) variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam, 0/1).

- It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.


# Example Use Cases

- Email spam detection (spam vs. not spam)

- Predicting if a customer will buy a product (yes/no)

- Medical diagnosis (disease vs. no disease)

- Credit risk modeling (default vs. non-default)
