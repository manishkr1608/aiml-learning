# Day 24 â€“ Communication Reflection

- Built my first CNN in PyTorch on CIFAR-10 dataset.  
- Learned the Command Pattern, and understood its usage to modularize ML tasks (training, evaluation).  
- Captured AI cost optimization strategies for scaling AI systems efficiently.  
- Solved Binary Tree Level Order Traversal coding problem, reinforcing BFS techniques.
