# Day 5 – Product Vision: ROI Calculation for AI Features

Every AI project should include a simple ROI calculation before investment.

### Example ROI Frame
- Cost: Data labeling, infra, model development → $50k  
- Expected Benefit: 
  - Reduce support tickets by 20% -> save $80k/year
  - Increase upsell conversions by 2% -> $40k/year

**ROI = (Benefits – Costs) / Costs = (120k – 50k) / 50k = 1.4 → 140%**

### Takeaway
Before building, I should quantify costs and benefits.  
If ROI < 1 (100%), the AI project may not be worth it.
