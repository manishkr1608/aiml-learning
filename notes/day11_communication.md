# Day 11 â€“ Communication Reflection

- Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest on Titanic dataset to understand trade-offs between simplicity and power.  
- Summarized design patterns (Proxy, Composite, Decorator) and product vision insights (churn, engagement, ROI vs risk).  
- Completed Week 2 coding practice set and documented learnings.  
- Felt progress this week in balancing coding, ML, architecture, leadership, and interview prep.
