# Day 1 – Product Vision & Leadership Note

## Topic: Why Purpose Must Lead AI Adoption

### Insight
AI should not be adopted as a "feature" for hype. It must be tied directly to a clear business problem and measurable outcome.

### Reflection
As a future AI Director/CTO, I must ensure every AI initiative is **ROI-driven**:
- Reduce costs (e.g., automate support to save X% of cost).  
- Improve customer experience (e.g., reduce response times).  
- Create new growth opportunities (e.g., personalization for upsell).  

### Takeaway
When evaluating AI opportunities, the first question to ask is:
*“What problem are we solving, and how does AI improve business outcomes?”*
