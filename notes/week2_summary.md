# Week 2 – Summary

## ML & Coding
- Built 3 ML models on Titanic dataset: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Compared models → Random Forest performed best overall
- Completed Week 2 coding practice set:
  - Two Sum (#1)
  - Valid Parentheses (#20)
  - Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock (#121)
  - Reinforcement problems (Three Sum, Best Stock with 2 transactions)

## Architecture & Patterns
- Proxy → lazy loading ML models
- Composite → chaining pipelines
- Decorator extension → timing/logging

## Product Vision
- Churn as a success metric
- Adoption vs engagement
- ROI vs Risk balance

## Reflection
Week 2 added more ML depth and introduced coding interview practice.  
I feel progress both as a hands-on ML developer and as a leader thinking about metrics and ROI.
