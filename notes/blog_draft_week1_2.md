# Blog Draft: My First 2 Weeks of AI Director Learning Journey

Over the past two weeks, I kicked off my structured journey towards becoming an AI Director.  
This is not just about coding — it’s about building end-to-end technical, architectural, and leadership readiness for AI products.

## Technical Progress
- Set up Python/Conda, GitHub repo, and practiced NumPy + pandas
- Built first ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Explored design patterns (SOLID, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Adapter, Proxy, Composite)

## Leadership/Product Insights
- AI must tie to ROI, not hype
- Success metrics matter: CSAT, churn, adoption, engagement
- ROI vs Risk is key for AI investment decisions

## Reflections
- Some days, I am able to give 2 hours and some days I am not able to spare any minute because of work, I try to spend extra time when I get time to cover up the lot pace.
- Balancing coding, architecture, and product vision created a holistic perspective
- Next step: more complex ML models and stronger coding practice

Stay tuned as I continue this journey
