# Day 35 – Product Vision: AI Lifecycle ROI

**Goal:** Quantify AI impact across the model lifecycle, not just at launch.

| Phase | Cost Metrics | Value Metrics | Key Levers |
|--------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Data Ops | Data collection & cleaning | Data reusability | Automate pipelines |
| Training | Compute + experiments | Accuracy improvement | Hyperparameter efficiency |
| Deployment | Infra + serving | Latency reduction | Batch vs real-time balance |
| Monitoring | Ops cost | Downtime avoided | Proactive drift detection |

**Leadership takeaway:** Treat AI ROI as a lifecycle metric -> ROI = (Value Created – Total Lifecycle Cost) / Lifecycle Cost.  
This shifts focus from “models built” to “value sustained in production.”
