# Day 21 – Product Vision: AI Product Lifecycle

**Insight:** AI products go through distinct lifecycle phases:

1. **Prototype:** Quick proof of concept (often API-based)  
2. **Pilot:** Internal or limited rollout, validate ROI/metrics  
3. **Scale:** Production readiness, monitoring, adoption focus  
4. **Maturity:** Continuous improvement, cost optimization, governance

**Takeaway:** AI leaders must recognize the lifecycle stage and apply the right strategies.  

E.g., don’t over-engineer a prototype, but don’t under-invest in monitoring at scale.
