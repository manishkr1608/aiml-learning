# Week 1 – Design Patterns Summary

## Patterns Covered
- Day 1: SOLID Principles
- Day 2: Factory & Singleton
- Day 3: Strategy
- Day 4: Observer
- Day 5: Decorator
- Day 6: Adapter

## Reflections
- Many patterns map directly to AI/ML pipelines:
  - Factory + Strategy → swapping models easily
  - Observer + Decorator → monitoring/tracking during training
  - Adapter → unify TensorFlow, PyTorch, sklearn models under one interface
- Patterns are crucial for building scalable, team-friendly AI systems.
