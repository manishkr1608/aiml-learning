# Day 24 – Product Vision: AI Cost Optimization

**Insight:** AI products must be cost-effective at scale.

### Key Areas
- **Training Costs:** Optimize batch size, early stopping, mixed precision
- **Inference Costs:** Quantization, pruning, efficient model serving
- **Cloud/GPU Costs:** Spot instances, autoscaling clusters
- **Operational Costs:** Monitoring to avoid wasted compute

**Takeaway:** AI leaders balance accuracy with cost efficiency — sustainable AI is both smart and economical.
