# Day 22 â€“ Product Vision: AI Product Risk Management

**Insight:** AI products carry unique risks beyond normal software.

### Categories of Risk
- **Bias & Fairness:** Biased training -> unfair outcomes
- **Compliance:** Privacy, GDPR, data handling
- **Security:** Adversarial attacks, model extraction
- **Operational:** Model drift, degraded accuracy

### Mitigation
- Bias testing pipelines
- Data governance policies
- Monitoring systems for drift
- Clear human-in-the-loop fail-safes

**Takeaway:** Risk management must be baked into the AI product lifecycle, not an afterthought.
