# Day 21 â€“ Communication Reflection

- Built my first Neural Network (MLPClassifier) on Iris dataset.  
- Learned the State Pattern, understood how to use it to ML workflows (data -> training -> evaluation).  
- Captured AI Product Lifecycle stages (prototype -> maturity) and the leadership strategies at each stage.  
- Solved the Linked List Cycle coding problem.  
- Great start to Week 4, moving deeper into ML and leadership thinking.
