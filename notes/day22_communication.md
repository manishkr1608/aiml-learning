# Day 22 â€“ Communication Reflection

- Built my first Neural Network Regressor (MLPRegressor) on Diabetes dataset, comparing neural nets to ensemble ML.  
- Learned Flyweight pattern, how we can connect it to embedding caching in NLP systems.  
- Captured risk management as a critical leadership responsibility in AI product development.  
- Completed the LRU Cache coding problem, reinforcing system design + data structure skills.
