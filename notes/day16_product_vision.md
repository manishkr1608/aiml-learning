**Insight:** AI leaders must prioritize features based on business value vs effort.  

### Example Prioritization Grid

- High Value + High Effort → Strategic Bets (recommendation engine, custom models)  
- Low Value + Low Effort → Opportunistic (nice-to-have analytics)  
- Low Value + High Effort → Avoid  

## Takeaway: Prioritization ensures scarce AI resources go to impactful projects.
