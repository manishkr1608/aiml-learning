# Day 23 – Product Vision: AI Scaling Strategy

**Insight:** Scaling AI products is not just about bigger models.

### Dimensions of Scaling
- **Data:** More diverse, higher quality datasets
- **Models:** Move from baseline ML → Deep Learning → LLMs
- **Infrastructure:** GPU/TPU clusters, distributed training
- **Organization:** Specialized teams (MLOps, Data Engineering, Applied AI)

**Takeaway:** True scaling = tech + data + infra + org maturity.
