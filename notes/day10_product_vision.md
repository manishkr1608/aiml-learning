# Day 10 â€“ Product Vision: ROI vs Risk in AI Projects

## Insight: ROI is important, but so is risk management.  

### Example
- Predicted ROI: +$200k/year from churn reduction  
- Risk: Model bias could cause compliance issues (lawsuits, fines).  

## Takeaway: AI leaders must weigh ROI vs Risk. A high ROI project may still be avoided if reputational/regulatory risks are too high.
