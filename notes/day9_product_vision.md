# Day 9 – Product Vision: Adoption vs Engagement Metrics

## Adoption rate ≠ engagement.  

- Adoption: % of users who try the AI feature.  
- Engagement: Frequency + depth of use.  

### Example:
- 10,000 users eligible for AI recommendations.  
- 4,000 adopted → 40% adoption.  
- Only 1,000 use weekly → 10% engaged.  

## Takeaway: Both adoption and engagement are needed. AI success is not just "tried once," but sustained usage.
