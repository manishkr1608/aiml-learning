# Day 12 â€“ Communication Reflection

- Revisited all Week 2 notebooks, added headers
- Updated project README with Week 2 summary.  
- Drafted my first Medium-style blog post combining Week 1 & 2 learnings.  
- Realized the value of communication: documenting progress helps me reflect and builds credibility for future AI leadership roles.
