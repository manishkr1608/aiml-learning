# Day 4 – Product Vision: Choosing the Right Metrics

Not all metrics are equal; must pick the right ones to evaluate AI.
An AI feature must be measured with the right success metrics, not vanity metrics.

### Key Metrics for AI Products
- CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score): Are customers happier after using the AI feature?  
- Churn Rate: Did the AI reduce the number of customers leaving?  
- Adoption Rate: How many users are actually using the AI feature?  
- Cost Savings: Did the AI reduce manual effort or operational costs?  

### Reflection
For AI initiatives, success is not the model’s accuracy alone but its business + user impact. 
AI features succeed only if metrics show real user + business impact 
Choosing the right mix of customer, adoption, and financial metrics ensures that AI features provide real ROI instead of being “cool but unused.”
