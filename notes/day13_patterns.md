# Day 13 – Pattern Reinforcement

## Patterns covered this week
- Proxy: lazy loading heavy models
- Composite: chaining pipeline steps
- Decorator: timing/logging

## Reflection
- Patterns are not "academic" — they map directly to ML pipeline design and production AI.
- This week showed how design patterns enable scalable, maintainable AI systems.
- Going forward, I’ll reuse these patterns when I build APIs and MLOps pipelines.
