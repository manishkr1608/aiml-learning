# Day 3 – Product Vision: Define Success Metrics Before Building

Outcome-led thinking is better than product-first hype. A TechRadar article highlights how rushing into tech like AI without defining problems or expected ROI can lead to costly failures. By contrast, successful initiatives start with measurable outcomes.

Principle:Every AI initiative must tie to clear metrics:
- Cost e.g., support cost –20%)
- Revenue (e.g., conversion +3%)
- Experience (CSAT +10%, response time –30%)

Guardrail: Run pilots with kill-switches if metrics don't trend positively.

Why:Prevents building AI for hype; ensures every initiative serves business value.
