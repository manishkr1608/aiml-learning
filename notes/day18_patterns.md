# Day 18 â€“ Pattern Recap (Week 3 so far)

- Builder - construct flexible ML pipelines
- Chain of Responsibility - preprocessing pipelines
- Facade - simplify ML systems for external use

## Reflection

Week 3 patterns show how complex AI systems can stay modular, flexible, and user-friendly.  

I see strong connections to production ML:  
- Builder - pipeline configs (scikit-learn, Airflow DAGs)  
- Chain - data preprocessing pipelines  
- Facade - exposing ML features to non-engineering teams
