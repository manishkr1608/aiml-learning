# Day 6 – Product Vision: Adoption Rate as a Key Metric

# Insight: Even if AI performs well technically, adoption may lag.  
# Adoption Rate = (Active users of AI feature) ÷ (Eligible users).  

### Example:
- 10,000 users eligible for AI recommendation system.  
- Only 4,000 actually use it regularly.  
- Adoption Rate = 40%.  

# Reflection: For AI products, adoption rate is critical → high accuracy doesn’t matter if users don’t adopt.
