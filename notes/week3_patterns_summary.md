# Week 3 â€“ Design Patterns Summary

## Patterns Covered
- Builder - assemble ML pipelines step by step
- Chain of Responsibility - modular preprocessing pipelines
- Facade - simplified ML system interface
- Mediator - coordinate components without direct coupling

## Reflection
Week 3 patterns showed how to manage complexity in AI systems:
- Builder + Chain : ML workflow construction
- Facade + Mediator : simplify and coordinate subsystems
Together, they prepare the foundation for scalable ML platforms.
