# Week 1 – Communication Reflection

This week I:
- Set up Python + Anaconda + GitHub repo
- Practiced pandas, NumPy, and first ML models
- Explored key design patterns (SOLID, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Adapter)
- Captured leadership/product insights around ROI, adoption, and metrics

## Personal Reflection
- Coding came back quickly — pandas + sklearn felt comfortable.
- Writing daily reflections helped connect technical work with leadership thinking.
