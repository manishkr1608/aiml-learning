# Week 3 â€“ Product Vision Insights

- Day 15: AI Roadmaps (short-term wins, long-term bets)
- Day 16: Prioritization (value vs effort)
- Day 17: North Star Metric (single guiding measure)
- Day 19: AI Team/Org Design (centralized vs embedded vs hybrid)

## Reflection
Week 3 shifted from just metrics (Week 2) to strategy & organization:
- Roadmaps provide direction
- Prioritization ensures impact
- North Star Metric unifies goals
- Org design ensures execution at scale
