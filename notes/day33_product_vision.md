# Day 33 â€“ Product Delivery Metrics for AI Teams

**Insight:** Delivery success for AI is about *business value consistency*, not model count.

| Metric Category | Example | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Velocity** | Avg. delivery time per model release | Predictability |
| **Stability** | Model drift frequency | Reliability |
| **Adoption** | % of product using AI features | Value realization |
| **ROI** | (Savings + Revenue) / Cost | Impact |

**Leadership takeaway:** Track *end-to-end* outcomes from data to user adoption, not just accuracy.
