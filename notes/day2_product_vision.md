# Day 2 â€“ Product Vision & Leadership Note

## Topic: Build vs Buy in AI Products

### Insight
Not every AI feature should be built from scratch. The choice depends on business strategy, ROI, and differentiation.

### When to Buy
- Commodity AI (OCR, translation, generic chatbots)
- Speed to market critical
- No unique data advantage
- Example: Use OpenAI API for fast MVP text summarization

### When to Build
- Core to differentiation and competitive advantage
- Access to unique data
- Need for customization or cost control at scale
- Example: Netflix building in-house recommendation engine

### Hybrid Approach
- Start with Buy (APIs) for quick validation
- Shift to Build once product-market fit and unique data exist

### Takeaway
always weigh time, differentiation, cost, and control before deciding.
