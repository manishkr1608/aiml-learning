- Built an LSTM model for text classification, learning how gating improves sequence modeling.  
- Learned Proxy pattern, applying it to AI inference serving with logging and security.  
- Captured compliance/regulatory requirements (GDPR, EU AI Act, HIPAA) as key leadership responsibilities.  
- Solved Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum, reinforcing recursion + dynamic programming on trees.
