# Day 13 – Communication Reflection

- Reinforced coding skills by tackling harder variations of Two Sum and Best Stock problems.  
- Consolidated understanding of Proxy, Composite, and Decorator patterns for AI system design.  
- Captured final Week 2 product vision insights around ROI and risk.  
- I feel Week 2 helped me balance ML coding, interview prep, architecture, and leadership thinking.  
- Next week, I’ll move into Week 3: More advanced ML models + new coding practice set + strategy/roadmap product vision.
